# Security Assessment Report – JPMorgan Chase & Co. (Hypothetical)

This project simulates a formal **Security Assessment Report (SAR)** created as part of a graduate-level course in cybersecurity at Rutgers University. The assignment places the student in the role of an Information Assurance Management Officer (IAMO), tasked with evaluating the security posture of a fictional organization in the financial sector.

## Project Summary

In response to the real-world 2015 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) data breach, this assessment evaluates a hypothetical version of JPMorgan Chase & Co. for insider threats, external attack vectors, and system vulnerabilities. The report outlines deficiencies in the company’s existing security posture and recommends layered mitigation strategies aligned with federal cybersecurity frameworks.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Threat Modeling**
  - Insider threats (negligent employees, unauthorized access, outdated hardware)
  - External threats (DDoS, brute force, SQL injection)

- **Vulnerability Analysis**
  - Lack of encryption for data at rest
  - Absence of database backups
  - Limited malware detection infrastructure

- **Security Posture Evaluation**
  - Use of Group Policy and VPNs
  - Gaps in auditing, data protection, and redundancy

- **Remediation Recommendations**
  - Group Policy audit logging and dual-approval for software installs
  - Real-time malware detection across all servers
  - Full implementation of encryption for at-rest and in-transit data
  - Physical backup systems with encrypted storage
